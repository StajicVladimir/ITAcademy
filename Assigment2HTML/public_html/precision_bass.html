            <h2>First. And still the best!</h2>
            <p>The Precision Bass (often shortened to "P-Bass") is a bass guitar 
                manufactured by <a href="http://www.fender.com">Fender Musical Instruments Corporation</a>. In its stock configuration the 
                Precision Bass is a solid body, four-stringed instrument equipped with a single split-coil 
                humbucking pickup and a one-piece, 20 fret maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard.
            </p>

                Its prototype, designed by Leo Fender in 1950, was brought to market in 1951, 
                the first electric bass to earn widespread attention and use, remaining among the 
                best-selling and most-imitated electric basses with considerable effect on the sound
                of popular music ever since.
            </p>

                The Standard P-Bass is sanded, painted and assembled in Ensenada, 
                Baja California, Mexico along with the other Standard Series guitars.
                Fender also produces Precision and Precision/Jazz basses in its Squier 
                line of products.
