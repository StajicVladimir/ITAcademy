            <p>
                The 4000 series were the first <a href="http://www.rickenbacker.com">Rickenbacker</a>
                bass guitars, 
                production beginning in 1957. The 4000 was followed by the very 
                popular 4001 (in 1961), the 4002 (limited edition bass 
                introduced in 1977), the 4008 (an eight-string model introduced 
                in the mid-1970s), the 4003 (in 1979, replacing the 4001 entirely
                in 1986 and still in production in 2012), and most recently the
                4004 series. There was also the 4005, a hollow-bodied bass guitar 
                (discontinued in 1984); it did not resemble any of the other 4000 
                series basses, but rather the new style 360-370 guitars. The 4001S 
                (introduced 1964) was basically a 4001 but with no binding and dot 
                fingerboard inlays. It was exported to England as the RM1999.
                However, Paul McCartney received the very first 4001S (his unit 
                was left-handed, and later modified to include a "zero fret").

                Rickenbacker basses have a distinctive tone. The 4001 and 4003
                basses have neck-through construction for more solid sustain due
                to more rigidity. The sustain at the bottom end is particularly 
                striking, and by routing the two outputs from the stereo "Rick-O-Sound"
                output, the brighter bridge pick up through a guitar rig and the
                bassier neck pickup through a bass setup, a particularly distinctive
                bass sound is produced. British bassist Chris Squire of Yes (band) 
                was one of the first musicians to 'supercharge' the classic 4001 sound 
                by splitting the output of his bass - he had his monophonic 4001 
                rewired to allow him to split the signal, sending the bass (neck)
                pickup output to a regular bass amplifier, and the treble (bridge)
                signal to a lead guitar amplifier. The 3000 series made from the
                mid-1970s to mid-1980s were cheaper instruments with bolt-on 21 
                fret necks. There was also a set neck 4000 version in 1975 and 76
                (neck set like a Gibson Les Paul) which had a 20-fret neck, dot 
                inlays, no binding (similar to the 4001S) but only a single bridge
                position mono pickup. Fred Turner of Bachman-Turner Overdrive 
                employed the 4000 extensively on the Not Fragile album, even 
                appearing on a promotional clip for "You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet"
                playing one in Fireglo.(more info needed)
